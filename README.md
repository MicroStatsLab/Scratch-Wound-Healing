The Scratch_Wound_Healing_Tools is based on the original wound_healing_size_tool by AlejandraArnedo, Felipe Torres Figueroa, Camila Clavijo, Pablo Arbeláez, Juan C Cruz, and Carolina Muñoz-Camargo. Without their diligent work, our modification would not have been possible.

Their original work can be viewed here: [Wound Healing Size Tool/AlejandraArnedo](https://github.com/AlejandraArnedo/Wound-healing-size-tool/wiki) or their published article on the plugin here: [An image J plugin for the high throughput image analysis of in vitro scratch wound healing assays](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7386569/).

We have modified the original Wound healing size tool macro to create the multiple wound healing size tool which can handle "multi-wound" images, images with more than one wound space.

For more information on how to use the plugin, please see the Scratch_Wound_Healing_Tools_Protocol located within the repo.
